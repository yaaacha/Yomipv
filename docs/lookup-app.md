## Lookup App

The Lookup App is an interactive overlay that displays dictionary definitions, pitch accents, and frequencies for words you select in MPV directly, All data is taken from your installed dictionaries in Yomitan.

## How it Works

The lookup window appears when you search for a word. Depending on your configuration, this can happen automatically or manually.

- **Automatic Lookup**: Can be disabled in your settings (`selector_lookup_on_hover`).
  - `selector_lookup_on_navigation` can also be enabled to trigger a lookup when navigating through the selector using Left/Right arrow keys.
- **Manual Lookup**: Press `Ctrl+c` (default) while hovering over a word in the selector.

The window stays on top of MPV until the selector is confirmed or cancelled. 
Right-click to lock the window, preventing accidental changes when the cursor moves over another word in the selector.

### Navigating Multiple Results
If a word has multiple entries, you will see a counter (like `1 / 3`) at the top.
- Click the Left/Right buttons of the lookup window to cycle through different entries.

### Sub-word Lookups
With `selector_lookup_on_hover` (enabled by default) and `selector_lookup_on_navigation`, you can open the lookup for sub-words directly from the subtitle.
You can also start a new search directly from the lookup window header:
- **Click any mora** in the headword to begin a new lookup from that position.
- **Right-click the header** to go back to the previous word you were looking at.

## Working with Definitions

### Selecting Text
- Just like in Yomitan’s popup, you can select any text inside definitions to populate your Selection Text field in Anki when `popup-selection-text` is being used.

### Choosing a Specific Dictionary
- **Click the Dictionary Title** to select that specific dictionary to populate the Definition field in Anki if `selected-dict` is being used.
- When you select a dictionary, `popup-selection-text` is ignored, and you can select text from the definition to be highlighted.

## Frequencies
- By default the lookup app will show the frequencies of the word you are looking up.
- You can disable this by setting `lookup_show_frequencies=no` in your `yomipv.conf` file.

## Ptich Accents
- By default, the Lookup App shows the pitch accents (if available) of the word you are looking up and also colors the word according to its pitch accent.
- TODO: Add option to disable this.
