# Yomipv

Yomipv is a script that combines Yomitan with MPV to create cards from Japanese media without leaving the player.
There's no need to do alt tabs to switch between MPV, texthooker and Yomitan while mining or doing word lookups. 
It was made designed to be used with [Senren Note Type v5.0.0](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren), but it should work with any note type.

TODO: Demo

## Requirements

- **[MPV](https://mpv.io/)** (0.33.0 or higher)
- **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** (Required for media extraction, but fallbacks to mpv's internal encoder if not found)
- **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)** with **[AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)**
- **[Yomitan](https://yomitan.wiki/)** and **[Yomitan Api](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan-api)**
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (Required for the lookup app)
- **curl** (Usually pre-installed on Windows, used for API requests)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your MPV directory and install dependencies:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%/mpv/`
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Yomipv && xcopy /e /i /y Yomipv . && rd /s /q Yomipv && cd scripts\yomipv\lookup-app && npm install
     ```
   
   - Linux: `~/.config/mpv/`
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Yomipv && cp -rn Yomipv/* . && rm -rf Yomipv && cd scripts/yomipv/lookup-app && npm install
     ```
3. **Configure Settings**:
   - Open `script-opts/yomipv.conf` and update your Anki deck/note type names and field mappings.

4. **External Services**:
   - Ensure Anki is running with AnkiConnect enabled.
   - Ensure Yomitan Api is running and the browser where the Yomitan extension is installed is open, and you have dictionaries installed.

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. Open a video with Japanese subtitles in MPV
2. Press **`c`** to activate the word selector
3. Navigate with **arrow keys** or **mouse hover** to select a word
4. Press **`Enter`**, **`c`**, or **left-click** to create an Anki card

### Advanced Features

- **Append Mode (`C`)**: Select multiple subtitle lines before exporting
  - Press `C` to enter append mode, `c` to export, or `C` again to cancel

- **Selection Expansion**:
  - **`Ctrl+Left`** / **`Ctrl+Right`**: Expand selection to adjacent words
  - **`Shift+Left`** / **`Shift+Right`**: Expand to previous/next subtitle line

- **Word Splitting (`s` or right-click)**: Split compound words into smaller segments

- **Dictionary Lookup (`Ctrl+c`)**: Open real-time dictionary definitions window that uses your yomitan glossary

- **History Panel (`a`)**: Toggle subtitle history panel
  - Click on previous/next lines to select them to expand the subtitle lines (when selector is open) or seek to that timestamp (when selector is closed)

## Troubleshooting

### Windows
- Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows scripts
- Check that curl is available at `C:\Windows\System32\curl.exe`
